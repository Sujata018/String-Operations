# String-Operations

StringStretch.c Given input as StretchString String factor, it stretches each character of String to the factor. 

largestCommonString.py --> Use dynamic programming to find longest common subsequence between two strings.

LISInteger_n2.py --> Use dynamic programming to find the longest increasing sequence can be formed from a given string of integers in input. Time complexity O(n^2).

LISInteger - nlogn.py -> Finds longest increasing integer sequence in a given integer string in O(n log n) time complexity.
